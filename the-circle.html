			<h2>The Circle</h2>

			<p>The Circle is an abstract furniture collection where Ossino experiments with geometry and time in everyday living spaces. A set of pieces reminiscent of a living room, the project deviates from a standard armchair and coffee table set.</p>

			<img src="img/the-circle/the-circle-img-annotations1.png" alt="A set of nude-coloured furniture designed by Ossino" width="1440" height="563">
			
			<p>The Circle seems like it was designed not for human comfort, but rather as a collection of conceptual sculptures. While this collection can be interpreted as cold, hard, and impersonal, its geometric beauty makes it seem like a living space for beings on another plane of existence.</p>

			<img src="img/the-circle/the-circle-img-annotations2.png" alt="The camera is peeking through a curved hole, zooming in on a sharp, right-angle corner of furniture" width="1440" height="563">

			<img src="img/the-circle/the-circle-img-annotations3.png" alt="Collage of images, one of a small table with a circular hole carved through its top and another of a circular hole cut into a vertical flat surface, through which a lighting fixture can be seen" width="1440" height="563">

			<p>These holes allow light to shine through and shadows are formed. This play on light further breaks up the smooth texture of the pieces.</p>

			<img src="img/the-circle/the-circle-img-annotations4.png" alt="Collage of two images showing a sundial-shaped structure from two angles" width="1440" height="563">

			<p>The structure is similar to a sundial or even a kitchen timer, alluding to the passing of time. Even the choice of clay and sand as materials, natural elements which weather over time, is an exploration of time through form.</p>

			<p>Ossinoâ€™s skillful use of geometry and line creates a poetic interpretation of time in The Circle. When combined in a space with other furniture items, pieces from The Circle add a calming structural elegance.</p>
